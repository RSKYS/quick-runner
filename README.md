### Okay red, what is this "quick-runner" of yours?

Well, I realized github started to get real ass.

I won't pay a single dime to a service that actually set limits just after discovered how do I use it; or maybe not, I'm paranoid person either way. \
The story began when I realized "No space left" for my CI, so github actually thinks I'd pay for it's pro to get more space for something that should've stayed free! hilarious; \
If you make something free, keep it free as it should be.

We don't want CI server to be uptime all the time, I'll make something with good resources whenever I need to test my PR's. \
Here's how to run this:
```
ansible-playbook -i inv.ini play.yml
```
